          <h4>Mindfulness is one of the best practices</h4>
          <p><i>Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment, which one can develop through the practice of meditation and through other training. Wikipedia</i></p>
          <p><q>Some experts believe that mindfulness works, in part, by helping people to accept their experiences—including painful emotions—rather than react to them with aversion and avoidance.
          <br>    
          It’s become increasingly common for mindfulness meditation to be combined with psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy. This development makes good sense, since both meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy share the common goal of helping people gain perspective on irrational, maladaptive, and self-defeating thoughts.</q> <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/harvard/benefits-of-mindfulness.htm" id="help-link">helpguide.org</a></p>
